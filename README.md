**`Tuii`** (pronounced `/tou·wee/`; stylized `{ Tuii }` or `{+}`) is a multipurpose app with random features and stuff.
<br>
It's made with **React Native Expo** and works on all that Expo works on _(namely; Android, iOS, Web)_

## Style

Tuii resembles that of old text-based user interfaces—yes, that's why it's called Tuii—but with a modern sleek look to it.
It also comes with different themes to choose from, so choose what suits you and your liking best!
<br>
I mean just look at these:

  <img alt="Degenerate mode" width="100" src="./preview/screenshots/theme-light.png">
  <img alt="Scarlatta mode" width="100" src="./preview/screenshots/theme-scarlatta.png">
  <img alt="Scarlatta mode" width="100" src="./preview/screenshots/theme-e9999.png">
</div>
<p align="center">Dark | Light | Scarlatta | E9999</p>

## Home Page

It offers simple stuff like current weather, a clock, Word of The Day card and Today's Quote card!

In order to customize it more take a look at the [settings](#settings).

## Applets

Currently, all there is is [Sudoku](#-sudoku) and [TicTacToe](#-tictactoe), but expect more to come!

### • Sudoku

You can mark slots, reveal them _(if you're a loser)_, decide whether conflicts should be highlighted, or if you can see how many of each number is remaining, or how many empty slots are there.
<br>
You can also be shamed if you don't do effort! How amazing!
The world needs more mean bullying! **:D**

</div>

### • TicTacToe

Whether you call it tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses _(WTF are you if you call it that)_, X/O or Xs & Os. I don't believe it needs to be described; you know it already _(unless you're a loser)_.
<br>
You can adjust the difficulty and whether you play against the CPU or play with yourself... not- uhh, you know what I meant, goddammit.

  <img alt="TicTactoe settings" width="100" src="./preview/screenshots/applet-ttt2.png">
</div>

## Settings

This is where you customize and adjust stuff as you like. It kind of looks like this:
