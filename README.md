**Tuii** is a multipurpose app with random features and stuff.
<br/>
It's made with **React Native Expo** and works on all that Expo works on _(namely; Android, iOS, Web)_

## Style

Tuii resembles that of old text-based user interfaces—yes, that's why it's called Tuii—but with a modern sleek look to it.
It also comes with different themes to choose from, so choose what suits you and your liking best!
<br/>
I mean just look at these:
